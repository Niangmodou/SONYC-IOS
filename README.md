# SONYC-IOS-APP

1) Record 10 sec audio clips using the phone's microphone and store the clip locally (make sure you can delete the clips too)

2) Use the phone's microphone to capture a stream of audio data and calculate an SPL (sound pressure level) reading. SPL is the dB measure typically given in noise meters (there are a number of apps that do this if you want to check them out e.g. NIOSH SLM)
